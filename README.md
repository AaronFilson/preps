A web app to help people prepare for an earthquake.

This project is to help people in the Puget Sound area to prepare for a large and destructive earthquake.

There are 5 pages currently, including an about us page. We envision further expansion of the pages in a future version.

This project was authored by Aaron Filson, Carolyn Robinson, Roland San Nicolas, and Sabrina Tee.
